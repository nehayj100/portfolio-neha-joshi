								<h2>COVID-19 Pandemic-Driven Product Backlog Assessment - A Time Series Forecasting Approach </h2>
									Merck US <br>
									Note: Exact sales figures could not be reported as confidential to Merck US
									<br/>
									<strong>Tools and methods: </strong> Time Series Forecasting, Linear Regression, Hierarchial Clustering, SQL

								<strong>About the Project: </strong>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li>Numerous elective surgeries were postponed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
									<li>Consequently, sales of the considered project, an anesthesia reversal agent, declined.</li>
									<li>A significant backlog emerged in the sales of the product.</li>
									<li>The objective at hand was to assess the backlog generated in the sale of the product from mid-2020 to mid-2022.</li>
									<li>Additionally, we identified the top 20 target hospitals in the country to address this backlog.</li>
								</ul>


								<strong>Backlog Calculation: </strong>

								<ul>
									<li>Firstly, time series forecasting was performed to forecast the sales of the product HAD COVID NOT HAPPENED.</li>
									<li>Multiple time series forecasting models were used- including ARIMA, SARIMAX, Holt Winter's exponential smoothing, fbProphet.</li>
									<li>fbProphet performed the best and hence the forecast was considered as final.</li>
									<li>Now the difference between the forecasted and actual sales was considered as Backlog.</li>
									<li>Following figures make the methodology clearer.</li>
								</ul>

								<strong>Target Hospitals Identification: </strong>

								<ul>
									<li>Hospitals were clustered into 3 major clusters - Low, Medium and High Sales.</li>
									<li>100+ hospital specific features were available in the data - including # beds, # rooms, # surgeons, # anesthesiologists, # nurses, revenue etc.</li>
									<li>A regression model was built in each of the 3 clusters after performing feature selection for each cluster (from the above features).</li>
									<li>As per the selected features, the model had a estimate of the expected sales for each hospital.</li>
									<li>The hospitals were ranked in the descending order of difference in expected and actual sales.</li>
									<li>Finally, top 20 hospitals (across all 3 clusters) were identified as targets- since huge sales opportunity was observed</li>
								</ul>
