											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Hello! I'm Neha Joshi, a tech enthusiast from Texas, USA, with a strong academic and professional background in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have done my undergrad from one of the top Indian Institutions (NIT Nagpur) with a convocation gold medal and academic excellence prize.

											I kick started my career as a Machine Learning Engineer at a leading Indian consulting firm, collaborating on impactful projects with Merck US. Transitioning to academia, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at the esteemed Texas A&M University, focusing on Machine Learning and AI.

											Alongside my studies, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for a Data Science course, facilitating lab sessions for senior engineering students. Currently, I'm immersed in Multimodal Deep Learning Research at the STMI lab, working on calorie prediction using meal images for diabetes patients, with a focus on self-supervised learning techniques.
