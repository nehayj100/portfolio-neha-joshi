								<strong>About the Project: </strong>
								<br>
								<ul>
										<li>The main goal of the project is to perform accurate calorie prediction from food images. The subjects considered for the project are obligated to send us images of their meals throughout the day.</li>
										<li>The food considered is not a single ingredient but complex recipies like Burritos, Rice Meat Bowls etc </li>
										<li>Owing to the scarcity of data, the calorie detection modelis built in two steps: pre-trainig and fine-tuning.</li>
										<li>Firstly, Self-Supervised pre-training (which has gained a lot of attention in reserch since the past 5 years) was done. We implemented DINO, BYOL, SumCLR where pre-traning was done on a massive 1M recipe dataset and fine -tuning was done on the real world dataset that we collected.</li>
										<li>The results were promising (upto 80% accurate predictions) but there was a scope of improvement.</li>
										<li>Further, Supervised Pretraining was tried with mdoels like VGG19, ResNet50, Inception v3 etc. Here individual model pre-training results were  not satisfactory.</li>
										<li>We went one step ahead and designed an architecture of an Ensemble model which performed very well.</li>
										<li>Surgical fine tuning of this model is in progress and state of the art results are expected for calorie estimation using mere food images.</li>
